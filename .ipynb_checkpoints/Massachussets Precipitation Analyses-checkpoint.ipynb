    "# Massachusetts Precipitation Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I'll analyze Massachusetts precipitation data to understand changing weather and climate patterns and predict what this winter's wet weather will look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As weather conditions in the Northeast became hotter and drier in the summer of 2022 (), many Bay Staters will have become more familiar with red and orange maps showing the statewide drought risk. Since moving to the Boston area in 2018, I feel like I have watched the weather change and the climate shift. It's hotter and I have to water my plants more often. It seems like there are fewer thunderstorms in the summer and a bit less snow on the ground   eery year. The consequences are commonsense: indoor and outdoor water usage increases as reservoir and groundwater levels drop, vegetation dries out, and fire risks increase. \n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"ma_drought_map_09-08-22.jpg\" title =\"A map of drought conditions across Massachusetts during August 2022. Source: <https://www.mass.gov/doc/august-24-2022/download>\" width=\"400\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "As a west-coaster, I grew up passing permanent signage whose heavy arrows always seemed permanently weighted towards that red area - Extreme Risk. Every fire season had its regular calling cards: the road signs, their silent warnings, and the dried grass at their bases. We would start looking earlier though, aiming our eyes at the Cascade Mountains and waiting for the snow to fall. To melt. \n",

    "<img src=\"Crooked_River_Ranch_firesign.jpg\" title =\"A fire danger sign in Jefferson County, Oregon showing extreme fire danger. Source: <https://www.crrfire.org/fire-danger-increases-to-extreme-campfires-closed>\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, global climate change is driving shifts in where and how much precipitation falls. While floods submerge Pakistan, droughts imperil American agriculture (). It feels like we are waiting again, many of us asking, \"How will these changing climate patterns affect us? Our homes?\" This question might seem dramatic, but its pragmatic cousin is asked more frequently: \"What's the weather forecast?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "A forecast is a model that is based on the prior results that helps us anticipate and plan for future conditions. Weather- the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place- can be measured and analyzed to produce models of the climate- atmpsheric patterns across broader regions and timespans. These models, based on the past, can be used to predict future conditions. However, if the weather conditions being predicted have changed from the conditions used to build the model, the climate model will not be able to accurately predict the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an earth scientist, I'm deeply curious about how terrestrial conditions like climate impact organisms' abilities to navigate thier environment. As a Bostonian, I  want to know if I can expect a wet winter in 2022 (and replenished aquifers and reservoirs going into 2023). My goal in this analysis is limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- cleaning the data and structuring it in multiple useful forms\n",
    "- calculating and analyzing metrics to quantify data completeness and range, etc.\n",
    "- creating supervised machine learning models using linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost methods and the scikit-library for one station and comparing the predicted and exprected values\n",
    "- predicting the monthly precipitation at that station for January to July 2023"

    "I used the 'Precipitation Database Data 2019' dataset from the Massachusetts Department of Conservation & Recreation's Office of Water Resources (https://www.mass.gov/info-details/precipitation-data). This dataset is comprised of observed monthly preciptiation totals (in inches) for weather stations around Massachusetts. It can be difficult to compare snowfall to rainfall  given water content in snow is variable (consider 'powder' snow and snowball-packing snow); in this dataset, snowfall is melted and reported as equivalent inches of water. \n",

The only difference is that the Conchord basin is now called SuAsCo (Sudbury-Assabet-Concord). Additional information regarding this dataset archived elsewhere may clarify what a Region Composite Station means in terms of data collection. The regions correspond to the drought regions (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/drought-regions) except for the Cape Cod and Islands regions, which have been combined.\n",

The records with no region could potentially be assigned to regions, but towns cannot be assigned to drainage basins without expert determination. I think the regions correspond to the MA drought regions (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/drought-regions), but since I cannot confirm this, I solve the issue entirely by removing the station records where Basin Name and Region are NaN."
